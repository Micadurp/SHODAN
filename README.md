SHODAN - a bot
===================================
Initially I just want to be able to send messages across clients in order to connect different chat clients that people insist on using. The reason is easily explained with an XKCD comic https://xkcd.com/927/.
- [ ] Send and recieve messages using XMPP or whatever can communicate with IRC
- [ ] Send and recieve messages to/from Slack
- [ ] Send and recieve messages to/from Discord

Plan is to make able to handle if you dont want to use a module
